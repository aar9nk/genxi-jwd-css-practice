# CSS practice

## Description

Use this project to try some of the css learnings in your own environment! There are some [hints](/hints) and the [solution](/solution), but try to complete it without the solution and only look at it once you have a working example. Learning to use google and searching the internet is something we need to learn.

### The setup

1. `git clone` this repository into a folder in your terminal
2. `cd` into the directory and use `open index.html` to open it in your browser

### Example

[Have a look at a finished example](https://jwd-css-practice.netlify.app/)

### Optional extras

- Host the folder on github pages for free so you can show others a working demo!
- Practice collaborating with your colleagues by forking and then working on their repos.
